# Project README

## Project Overview
This project involves scraping data from Goodreads.com to gather information on 1000 books. The scraped data was cleaned and stored in a CSV file (`Clean book list 1000.csv`) for analysis. Additionally, a Power BI report (`book catalog.pbix`) was created to analyze the popularity of authors and books based on the collected data.

## Files Included
1. **Books scraping.ipynb**:
   - Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for scraping data from Goodreads.com.
   - Use this notebook to replicate the data scraping process or modify parameters as needed.

2. **Clean book list 1000.csv**:
   - CSV file containing the cleaned dataset of 1000 books extracted from Goodreads.com.
   - This file serves as the input data for analysis in Power BI.

3. **book catalog.pbix**:
   - Power BI file containing the report and visualizations analyzing the popularity of authors and books.
   - Open this file in Power BI to explore the visualizations and insights derived from the dataset.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python**: Used for web scraping and initial data cleaning.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis in Python.
- **Excel**: Used to store the cleaned dataset (`Clean book list 1000.csv`).
- **Power BI**: Business analytics tool for visualizing and analyzing data.

## Project Goals
The primary goals of this project were:
- To scrape and collect data on 1000 books from Goodreads.com.
- To clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
- To analyze the popularity of authors and books based on the collected data using Power BI.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Data Scraping**:
   - Open `Books scraping.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Execute the cells in the notebook to scrape data from Goodreads.com.
   - Adjust parameters as needed.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - The dataset should already be cleaned and stored in `Clean book list 1000.csv`.
   - Optionally, review and modify the cleaning process in Python as per additional requirements.

3. **Power BI Analysis**:
   - Open `book catalog.pbix` in Power BI Desktop.
   - Connect to `Clean book list 1000.csv` as the data source.
   - Explore the provided visualizations and create new ones to analyze author and book popularity.
   - Use Power BI's capabilities to gain insights and create interactive reports.

## Conclusion
This project showcases the process of scraping book data from Goodreads.com, cleaning the dataset, and analyzing author and book popularity using Power BI. Users can replicate the scraping and cleaning process using the provided notebook and further analyze the dataset using the Power BI report.
